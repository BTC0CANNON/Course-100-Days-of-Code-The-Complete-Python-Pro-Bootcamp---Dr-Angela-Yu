Days 16-100. All my work. Keep an eye out for docstrings ("""). Sometimes I note my code vs Angela's code, or include a bit of extra things I used or found along the way. If you are here to look for solutions, I heavily suggest you only look to get an idea and then go write your own code. If you copy/paste you lose out on learning the necessary fundamentals. I will add each day as I complete them.
